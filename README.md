# Ancient Script Restoration and Script Recovery   from Tamil Palm Leaves
### Objective :
The objective of this project is to develop an AI-driven system for the restoration and text recovery of ancient Tamil palm leaf manuscripts. The key goals include: 
•	Enhancing Degraded Manuscripts: Utilizing advanced image processing techniques to enhance faded text, remove noise, and reconstruct missing portions while preserving the original script.
•	Optimized OCR for Ancient Tamil Scripts: Developing a robust Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model specifically designed to handle the challenges of ancient Tamil scripts, such as ink bleed-through, non-uniform spacing, and script variations across historical periods. 
•	Automated Text Extraction and Recognition: Implementing AI-based models to accurately identify and extract text from palm leaf manuscripts, ensuring readability and authenticity. 
•	Preserving Cultural Heritage: Establishing a scalable AI-assisted approach to safeguard Tamil literary and historical knowledge, enabling researchers and historians to study these texts effectively. 
This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional restoration methods and modern AI-powered techniques, ensuring the long-term preservation of Tamil manuscripts while maintaining their historical accuracy.
